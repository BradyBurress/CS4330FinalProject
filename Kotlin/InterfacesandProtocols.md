#Interfaces and Protocols


Interfaces contain abstract methods and implemented methods. Interfaces can only have abstract properties.


Interfaces are defined the same way as classes, but with the 'interface' keyword instead of 'class'


```
interface Interface{

  fun requiredFunction()

}
```


A class can have multiple interfaces in Kotlin.
