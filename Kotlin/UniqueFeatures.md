#Unique Features


Kotlin is considered to be a modern language because of features such as:


#Optionals


In Kotlin variables can not be set to null unless you allow them to be


#Non-required Semicolons


Kotlin can infer when a semicolon would be used which makes it more readable


#Multi-value Returns


This is a feature that is not directly available in Java, but is very useful.
