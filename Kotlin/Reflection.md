#Reflections


Reflection abilities are the way Kotlin allows for inspecting elements at runtime. 


Introspecting functions and properties is an important part of functional or reactive programming in Kotlin.


Kotlin's Reflection capabilities can be used to reflect on:


* Class References
* Bound Class References
* Callable References
* Function References
* Property References
* Interoperability with Java 
* Constructor References
* Bound Function and Property References
