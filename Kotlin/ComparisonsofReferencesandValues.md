#Comparisons of References and Values


Kotlin uses two equals signs to compare the values of two types or objects, and three equals signs to check if they share the same address


Structural


```
if(a==b) //Checks if a and b have the same value
```


Referential


```
if(a===b) //Checks if a and b have the same address
```
