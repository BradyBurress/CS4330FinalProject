# Language Purpose


Kotlin was invented as an improvement of java that is still compatible with java libraries. It was also intended to be an attraction to increase sales of the IntelliJ IDEA


The JetBrains team wanted features that were formerly unavailable in existing languages without increasing compile times


Kotlin is largely a reaction to java that seeks to fix the issues and modernize it with features like optionals
