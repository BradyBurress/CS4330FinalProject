# Types


Kotlin is a strongly typed language that supports type inference or deduction.


```
val name = "Brady"
```

The type string does not have to be stated because the compiler can infer that it is a string.


The primitive data types in Kotlin are:


* Byte
* Int
* Long
* Float
* Double
* Char
* Short


Enums in Kotlin are classes which means they are reference type and new value types can not be created.
