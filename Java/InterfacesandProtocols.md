# Interfaces and Protocols 


Interfaces in Java contain method signatures which when implemented on a class require it to provide implementation for the functions


```
public interface ExampleInterface {

}


public class ExampleClass implements ExampleInterface {

}
```


Interfaces ensure that a class has certain functionality
