#Language Purpose


Java was created with the intent of creating a language that can run on any platform without increasing compule time. 


The basis for the design is evident in their motto: "Write Once, Run Anywhere"


Java was also intended to be able to run on simple electronic devices by using the object oriented model to allow manipulation of real objects.
