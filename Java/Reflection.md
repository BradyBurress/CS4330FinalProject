#Reflection


Methods such as getClass(), getConstructors(), getMethods() are ways to check properties of an object.


```
if(obj.getClass().equals("String"){
  System.out.println("This is a string");
}
```

getClass is a very common and useful method used to determine what methods can be called on an object by checking what kind of object it is.
