# Errors and Exception Handling


The primary way to handle errors is by using try and catch blocks to perform potentially unsafe operations in a way that stops them from crashing the entire program.


Exceptions thrown will be caught by the catch blocks preventing things like NullPointerExceptions from derailing everything.


```
try{

} catch (Exception1 e1){

} catch (Exception2 e2){

}
```
